            <h1>Chess Toolkit Manual</h1>

<p>Chess Toolkit is a software library for creating chess programs.  It is written in C with an object-oriented API, so it is straightforward to use on its own or to extend another language such as Ruby.</p>

<p>The Chess Toolkit is a work in progress, but it is quite useful in its current state.  It understands the rules of chess, Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN), Short Algebraic Notation (SAN), and the basics of Portable Game Notation (PGN).  With the current features, you can do a lot.  For example, the author has used it to write software that parses through millions of games, collecting statistics on openings and scoring each position based on the game results and player ratings.  Hopefully you will find it useful too.</p>

<p>This document is the Chess Toolkit's primary documentation, though many questions can also be answered by exploring the comprehensive unit test suite in the tests directory, or by reviewing the library's code in the lib directory.  This document is organized into the following sections:</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>The Chess Toolkit uses the standard GNU autoconf tools, so you can build from source by running</p>

<pre><code>./configure
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>Optionally, if you wish to run the unit tests and have GNU check installed, you can run</p>

<pre><code>make check
</code></pre>

<p>To run the long version of the unit tests, which executes more <a href="http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Perft">perfts</a>, you can first run </p>

<pre><code>export CT_CHECK_LONG=1
make check
</code></pre>

<p>See INSTALL for all the usual autconf installation details.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following example is included in examples/filter_position/filter_position.c.  It's a simple program you might use to filter a PGN file, printing out only those games that include the position reached by the movetext you pass in.  For instance, you can command <code>./filter_position "e4 c5" &lt; ../../tests/candidates2013.pgn</code> to see those games where the Sicilian Defense was played.  This program is only meant to demonstrate the basics of the Chess Toolkit API.  If you were trying to filter millions of games, this program would eventually get the job done, but hashing every position from every game is not a computationally efficient approach.</p>

<h2>Data Types</h2>

<p>chess_toolkit.h includes stdint.h and stdbool.h since it uses some of these standard data types in function declarations as you'll see in the next section.  See lib/chess_toolkit/ct_types.h for more information.</p>

<p><strong>CtSquare</strong> is an enum, and defines A1, A2, ... H8.  It also defines SQUARE_NOT_FOUND and NUMBER_OF_SQUARES.</p>

<p><strong>CtFile</strong> is an enum, and defines FILE_A, FILE_B, ... FILE_H.  It also defines FILE_NOT_FOUND and NUMBER_OF_FILES.  Additionally an anonymous enum defines, LAST_FILE = FILE_H.</p>

<p><strong>CtRank</strong> is an enum, and defines RANK_1, RANK_2, ... RANK_8.  It also defines RANK_NOT_FOUND and NUMBER_OF_RANKS.  Additionally an anonymous enum defines, LAST_RANK = RANK_8.</p>

<p><strong>CtDirection</strong> is an enum, and defines the different offsets from any square as compass directions (from white's perspective with North meaning one rank forward and East meaning one file right).  For instance A1 + D_N == A2, and B2 + D_NE == C3.  The directions are: D_NONE, D_N, D_E, D_S, D_W, D_NE, D_SE, D_SW, D_NW, D_NNE, D_ENE, D_ESE, D_SSE, D_SSW, D_WSW, D_WNW, and D_NNW.</p>

<p><strong>CtPiece</strong> is an enum, and defines values for each piece (WHITE_KING, WHITE_QUEEN, etc.), including EMPTY.  The value for each piece was carefully chosen to help categorize the piece by color or type, useful in move generation.  See ct_types.h for more details.</p>

<p><strong>CtPieceColor</strong> is an enum, and defines two values WHITE_PIECE and BLACK_PIECE.</p>

<p><strong>CtBitBoard</strong> is an uint64_t with one bit for each square on the board.  The low order bit (bit 0) represents square A1, and it proceeds across each rank before moving up to the next file.  A1, A2, ... A8, B1, B2, ... H7, H8.  Several macros are defined to create bit boards: BITB_EMPTY, BITB_FULL, and BITB_ONE.</p>

<p><strong>CtBitBoardArray</strong> is a pointer to an array of CtBitBoard values, indexed by the piece value.  For instance, bit_board_array[WHITE_KING] should return a bit board with one bit set corresponding to the white king's position on the board.  bit_board_array[EMPTY] returns a bit board marking all the empty squares.</p>

<p><strong>CtPosition</strong> is the first of several abstract data types (ADT) to be mentioned here.  Basically, it is a pointer to a representation of a chess position.  Like most of the ADTs, it reveals little about its internal representation, and you treat it as you would an object in object oriented programming.</p>

<p><strong>CtCastleRights</strong> is an enum, and defines 16 possible states corresponding to whether or not each side still has the right to castle kingside or queenside.  If no one can castle any more, the castling rights are CASTLE_NONE.  If both players can castle either direction, it is CASTLE_KQkq.  The other 14 possible combinations are represented by removing the corresponding letter from KQkq; for instance, if white can only castle kingside and black can only castle queenside, castle rights are CASTLE_Kq.</p>

<p><strong>CtMove</strong> is an int16_t, however which bits mean what is not specified in its type definition.  Other than its size being specified, it is treated as an ADT.  Two special moves are defined by an anonymous enum: NULL_MOVE and AMBIGUOUS_MOVE.</p>

<p><strong>CtMoveType</strong> is an enum, and defines several move types, useful in notating moves and making moves on the board: NORMAL_MOVE, CASTLE_KINGSIDE, CASTLE_QUEENSIDE, EN_PASSANT_POSSIBLE, EN_PASSANT_CAPTURE, and PROMOTION.</p>

<p><strong>CtMoveStack</strong> is an ADT used to collect moves.</p>

<p><strong>CtGraph</strong> is an ADT used to navigate from one position to the next given a move.  Each graph starts from a given chess position and saves the moves it is provided as it transitions from one position to the next.  This is the most useful object in the Chess Toolkit.</p>

<p><strong>CtGameTags</strong> is an ADT used to store tag pairs describing a chess game.  Currently, it is limited to the following tags: Event, Site, Date, Round, White, Black, Result, WhiteElo, BlackElo and ECO.  A future release is likely to add the FEN tag so that graphs from positions other than the standard initial position are easier to work with.</p>

<p><strong>CtCommand</strong> is a pointer to a <strong>CtCommandStruct</strong>.  The reason CtCommandStruct is available, is there could be cases where you'd rather not manually manage memory for each command; then it's handy to reference the struct version.  The command object follows the command design pattern.  It is provided a delegate and a method which accepts that delegate.  Passing a command object allows a the receiver to easily callback to the delegate of your command.  There are several variants of this command object.</p>

<p><strong>CtMoveCommand</strong> is a pointer to a <strong>CtMoveCommandStruct</strong>.  It follows the command design pattern, and takes an argument of CtMove.</p>

<p><strong>CtPieceCommand</strong> is a pointer to a <strong>CtPieceCommandStruct</strong>.  It follows the command design pattern, and takes two arguments: CtPiece and CtSquare.</p>

<h2>Memory Management</h2>

<p>Any of the Chess Toolkit types that are enums (CtSquare, CtFile, etc.) or integers (CtBitBoard and CtMove) are passed by value and do not require any special memory management.  To distinguish their creation from other types that require explicit memory management, their constructors use the word "make" instead of "new".  Here are several examples:</p>

<pre><code>CtSquare square = ct_square_make(FILE_E, RANK_2);
CtMove move = ct_move_make(E2, E4);
CtBitBoard bit_board = ct_bit_board_make();
</code></pre>

<p>Those values that are ADTs, do require some care.  They are usually created by a "new" function and must later be released by the corresponding "free" function or your program will leak memory.  For instance, a new CtPosition is created with:</p>

<pre><code>position = ct_position_new();
</code></pre>

<p>This position must later by released with:</p>

<pre><code>ct_position_free(position);
</code></pre>

<p>There are similar functions to free other ADTs, including CtMoveStack, CtGraph, CtGameTags, and the commands (CtCommand, CtMoveCommand and CtPieceCommand).</p>

<h3>Special Cases: CtBitBoardArrays</h3>

<p>CtBitBoardArrays do not have new or free functions.  They should be defined like so:</p>

<pre><code>CtBitBoard bit_board_array[CT_BIT_BOARD_ARRAY_LENGTH];
</code></pre>

<p>or with your choice of malloc, calloc, etc.</p>

<pre><code>CtBitBoard *bit_board_array = malloc(CT_BIT_BOARD_ARRAY_LENGTH * sizeof(CtBitBoard));
/* use the bit board array and then later... */
free(bit_board_array);
</code></pre>

<h3>Special Cases: Commands</h3>

<p>If you would rather not use the new and free functions for a command, you can use the make functions instead.</p>

<pre><code>CtCommandStruct command_struct = ct_command_make(delegate, function);
CtCommand command = &amp;command_struct; /* or you just remember to use &amp;command_struct where you would use command */
</code></pre>

<p>Since a CtCommand is just a pointer to CtCommand struct, you could also write it this way:</p>

<pre><code>CtCommandStruct command[] = { ct_command_make(delegate, function) };
</code></pre>

<p>Both of the above are equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>CtCommand command = ct_command_new(delegate, function);
/* use the command and then later... */
ct_command_free(command);
</code></pre>

<p>but in the former cases, you never need to free anything, which comes in handy.</p>

<h3>Special Cases: to destination</h3>

<p>Several functions write to an object (string, position or graph).  Assuming the caller provides an object to write to, it writes there and returns the result.  However, as a convenience, the caller can pass in zero.  This signifies the caller wants to use a shared object that they don't have to worry about freeing later.  This is handy, but in some ways it's also a double-edged sword.  Freeing the shared object will cause mysterious problems the next time this function is called.  Using the shared object is also not appropriate for multi-threaded applications; but it does make simple programs even simpler to write.  Here is an example using a shared destination:</p>

<pre><code>printf("Your last move was %s.\n", ct_move_to_s(move, 0));
</code></pre>

<p>without the shared destination, it could be written like this:</p>

<pre><code>char move_string[CT_MOVE_TO_S_MAX_LENGTH];
ct_move_to_s(move, move_string);
printf("Your last move was %s.\n", move_string);
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>char move_string[CT_MOVE_TO_S_MAX_LENGTH];
printf("Your last move was %s.\n", ct_move_to_s(move, move_string));
</code></pre>

<p>All three of these will produce the same result, but the first method, using the shared destination, would not work in a multi-threaded application where other threads could also call ct_move_to_s around the same time and unexpectedly change the shared destination to something else.</p>

<h3>Special Cases: to_new</h3>

<p>One function in particular is worth noting in regards to memory management, because it is unique.  ct_graph_to_new_pgn returns a newly allocated memory buffer.  It is up to the caller to later free this with free().  Most of the to_xxx functions write directly to a buffer (or a shared buffer).  However, in those cases, the maximum size of the object being written is known at compile time.  In this case, the length of the PGN written depends on how many moves the graph has, so it cannot be known until runtime.  Here is how it should be used:</p>

<pre><code>char * pgn = ct_graph_to_new_pgn(graph, game_tags);
/* use the pgn and then later... */
free(pgn);
</code></pre>

<h2>Functions</h2>

<pre><code>void chess_toolkit_init(void);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>must be called before using anything else in the toolkit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Error handling functions</h3>

<pre><code>void ct_error(const char *str);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>is called if something unexpected and catastrophic occurs (for instance running out of memory), but there is no reason your program can't call it as well.  The default behavior is to print a message to stdout and exit.  You can override this behavior with ct_error_set_custom_handler.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>typedef void (*CtErrorHandler) (const char *);
void ct_error_set_custom_handler(CtErrorHandler error_handler);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>is used to setup a custom error handler.  You pass it a function that takes const char * as an argument, and this function will be called instead of the default error handling function, should an unrecoverable error occur.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Square functions</h3>

<p>Please note that none of these square functions are designed to handle unexpected inputs.  For instance, ct_square_make assumes that it is being passed a valid file and rank.  If you pass it something unexpected, you will not get a meaningful result.  These are low-level functions written to run as fast as possible; they are not intended to be overly robust.</p>

<pre><code>CtSquare ct_square_make(CtFile file, CtRank rank);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>returns a CtSquare by value, given a file and rank.  It expects file is between FILE_A and FILE_H.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>CtFile ct_square_file(CtSquare square);
CtRank ct_square_rank(CtSquare square);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<pre><code>CtFile ct_file_from_char(char c);

</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>returns the rank corresponding to the character passed in.  It expects c is between '1' and '8'.  For instance, ct_rank_from_char('1') will return RANK_1.</p>

char ct_rank_to_char(CtRank rank);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>returns the character corresponding to the file or rank.  It expects file to be between FILE_A and FILE_H; rank between RANK_1 and RANK_8.</p>

</blockquote>

<pre><code>CtPiece ct_piece_from_char(char piece_char);
</code></pre>

If piece_char is either a B, K, N, P, Q, or R, it will return a Bishop, King, Knight, Pawn, Queen or Rook; White for uppercase and Black for lowercase.  For instance, given 'n' returns a BLACK_KNIGHT.  Any other character not corresponding to a chess piece returns EMPTY.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>char ct_piece_to_char(CtPiece piece);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>returns a character corresponding to the piece.  An invalid piece returns 0.  Otherwise, it returns an uppercase letter for white pieces and a lowercase letter for black pieces... B, K, N, P, Q, or R, for a Bishop, King, Knight, Pawn, Queen or Rook, respectively.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>CtPiece ct_piece_to_white(CtPiece piece);

<pre><code>bool ct_piece_is_pawn(CtPiece piece);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>returns true if the piece is a pawn; false otherwise.  Similar functions could test for other piece types, but it seems this was the only one needed thus far.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Bit Board functions</h3>

<pre><code>CtBitBoard ct_bit_board_make(CtSquare square);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>returns a CtBitBoard with a single bit set corresponding to the square.  It expects square is between A1 and H8.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>CtSquare ct_bit_board_find_first_square(CtBitBoard bit_board);

bool ct_bit_board_array_is_black_attacking(CtBitBoardArray bit_board_array, CtSquare square);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>examines the bit_board_array to determine if white (or black respectively) is attacking the square.  Using the bit board array in combination with some predetermined masks is an extremely fast way to see if the king is in check, and therefore if a position is legal.</p>
</blockquote>

</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>sets en-passant of the position to the file.  It expects file to be between FILE_A and FILE_H, but passing a square between A1 and H8 works also, and is equivalent to sending that square's file.  Passing NO_EN_PASSANT for the file will not work; to clear the en-passant state, use ct_position_clear_en_passant.</p>

<p>The next major feature I plan to work on is an API to support the Universal Chess Interface (UCI) protocol.  This protocol allows chess programs to communicate with a chess interface.  This would make the Chess Toolkit very useful in writing chess GUIs to many of the most popular chess engines.</p>

<p>A relatively simple and useful enhancement would be to add the FEN tag to the PGN related functions, so that the CtGraph object works better with PGN.  Right now, a PGN is assumed to start at the initial board position, but a CtGraph can start at any position.  This means that currently ct_graph_to_new_pgn and ct_graph_from_pgn will not work as intended for graphs / PGNs that start at positions other than the standard board setup.  This limitation / defect shouldn't be too difficult to correct.</p>

<p>Several minor changes and enhancements are being considered.  Under consideration are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>changing the command's execute method to return a boolean which could indicate whether or not to continue iterating.</li>
<li>adding methods to position to copy the bit board array and/or piece array to a specified destination.</li>
<li>adding the ability for a game tag to store and return arbitrary keys/value pairs (rather than its current implementation which is limited to the seven tag roster and player ELOs).</li>
<li>adding copy functions to all the objects (not just position).</li>
<li>adding a function for graph to dump all its moves to a newly allocated CtMove array, and a complimentary function to load from a move array.</li>
<li>lessening the restriction on modifying a graph during ct_graph_for_each_move_made and ct_graph_for_each_legal_move; however, the graph would need to protect itself to some extent against certain changes.</li>
<li>creating a mutable CtStringBuffer class and passing it to ct_graph_to_pgn, rather than requiring a new character buffer be created every time a PGN is written.</li>
</ul><p>Another interface change for consideration is the use of the command design pattern.  For instance, rather than passing a command to ct_graph_from_pgn_file, there could be a class that reads pgn files, and has methods like next_game and/or has_more_games.  This class could also store the error messages and scanner.  The original design had readers and writers for everything, which made for a good design in many regards, but an awkward API.  Most of these readers and writers are still in use (behind the scenes) because they help to keep the design clean.  Whether or not to expose and enhance some of the more useful readers such as CtPgnReader is something I will continue to question.</p>

<p>Adding some more scaffolding to turn the chess toolkit into a chess engine, capable of playing a game is something to consider.  It was never part of the plan, since there are already many great chess engines available.  But it would be fun, and educational; plus I could use it to test both sides of the UCI protocol feature.</p>

<p>A more complicated enhancement would be to enhance the PGN reader so it understands and does something useful with comments and/or recursive annotation.  This would allow the toolkit to support game annotation.  This could also be useful, but it's low on the priority list.</p>

<p>Another possible extension is to make other (smaller) board size options.  For instance, QuickChess is 5 files x 6 ranks.  In most places where files or ranks are iterated, I referenced LAST_FILE and LAST_RANK, with this enhancement in mind.  Along those lines, adding supporting Chess960 would also be interesting.  These are entertaining ideas, and perhaps not too difficult, but they are also low on the priority list.</p>
