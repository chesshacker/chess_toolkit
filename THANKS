Chess Toolkit THANKS

Chess Toolkit is an original work written by Steve Ortiz.  But I would like to add a special thanks to Marcel van Kervinck for sharing his program -- Marcel's Simple Chess Program <http://marcelk.net/mscp/>.  It was very educational as I was getting started in the world of chess programming.  Thank you Marcel!
